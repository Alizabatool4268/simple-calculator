# Introduction
This project is a simple calculator developed by me using TypeScript, Node.js, and Inquirer. It is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a command-line interface. The calculator provides a user-friendly experience by prompting users for inputs and displaying results instantly. It served as a great exercise for strengthening my understanding of TypeScript's type system, Node.js runtime environment, and interactive CLI development.

# Tech Stack
